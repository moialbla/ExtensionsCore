# ExtensionsCoreUtils
---

## Introduction

ExtensionsCoreUtils is a bundle of utilities that focus in optimize the more tedious configurations tasks with one o two lines of code.  

## Motivation

Even Net core is a great framework, it´s very complicate and tedious make configurations as others frameworks as Spring Java. Therefore, whit reference to knowledge of other technologies, i decide to build a simple and util core for developers. Any sugestion or pull request it´s welcome.	 

## Features

##### **Dependecy injection**

Currently, version 2.x, we need to configurate the D.I. a interfece and class to implements. 
When we have this, we need to configure in **ConfigureServices** on start up application.
If you have 100 interfaces you need 100 configurations. 
Unbelievable! with this utiilty you be able to decorate all classes and configure a autoscan. All clases will be injected into D.I.

How to use?
very simple
